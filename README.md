# Automatic Image Colorization
This repository contains the code for our course project for CS663 - Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing at IIT Bombay. We implemented the following paper/report: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2013/KabirzadehSousaBlaes-AutomaticColorizationOfGrayscaleImages.pdf. The published code was written in Python using `OpenCV`, `scikit-learn` and `pygco`. We were unable to execute it since some of the functions were outdated. We have coded our implementation in MATLAB.
